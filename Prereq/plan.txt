Based on the comprehensive requirements from the appDescription.txt file, I'll formulate a detailed development plan. Here's the structured approach:




Development Phases:

Phase 1 - Foundation 

Authentication & Multi-tenancy

Implement Supabase Auth

Setup Row Level Security (RLS)

Multi-tenant data isolation

Role-based access control

Core Database Schema

-- Example core tables
CREATE TABLE tenants (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  name TEXT,
  settings JSONB
);

CREATE TABLE users (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  tenant_id UUID REFERENCES tenants,
  role TEXT
);

CREATE TABLE products (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  tenant_id UUID,
  name TEXT,
  price DECIMAL
);

Technical Guidelines:

State Management:

// Use Riverpod for state management
final dashboardProvider = StateNotifierProvider<DashboardNotifier, DashboardState>((ref) {
  return DashboardNotifier();
});

API Integration:

// Use Repository pattern
abstract class InvoiceRepository {
  Future<List<Invoice>> getInvoices();
  Future<void> createInvoice(Invoice invoice);
}

class SupabaseInvoiceRepository implements InvoiceRepository {
  final SupabaseClient _client;
  
  Future<List<Invoice>> getInvoices() async {
    // Implement with proper error handling
  }
}

UI/UX Implementation:

Follow Material Design 3

Implement custom theme system

Responsive design for all screens

Accessibility compliance

Testing Strategy:

// Unit Tests
void main() {
  group('Invoice Tests', () {
    test('should calculate total correctly', () {
      final invoice = Invoice(...);
      expect(invoice.calculateTotal(), equals(expectedTotal));
    });
  });
}

Security Measures:

Implement proper data encryption

Secure file storage

API security with JWT

Regular security audits

Performance Guidelines:

Lazy loading for lists

Image optimization

Caching strategies

Background processing for heavy tasks

Deployment Strategy:

CI/CD pipeline setup

Staging environment

Production deployment

Monitoring setup

Timeline Estimation:

Total Development: 19-23 weeks

Additional 2-3 weeks for testing

1-2 weeks for deployment and stabilization

Key Success Metrics:

Response time < 2 seconds

99.9% uptime

< 1s dashboard load time

Zero data leaks between tenants

Regular Milestones:

Weekly code reviews

Bi-weekly feature demos

Monthly security audits

Quarterly performance reviews

This plan provides a structured approach to development while maintaining flexibility for adjustments based on feedback and changing requirements. Would you like me to elaborate on any specific aspect of this plan?
